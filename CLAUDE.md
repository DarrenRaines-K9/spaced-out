# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a portfolio project called "spaced-out". The repository is currently in its initial state with only a basic README.md file and git repository structure.

## Current State

- This is a minimal portfolio project repository
- Contains only a README.md file with basic project description
- No package.json, build system, or source code files are present yet
- The project appears to be in the early setup/planning phase

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository without a defined tech stack:

- No build commands are available yet
- No test framework is configured
- No linting or formatting tools are set up
- No dependencies are defined

## Next Steps for Development

When setting up this portfolio project, typical considerations would include:

- Choose a framework/technology stack
- Add package.json with appropriate scripts
- Set up build and development workflows
- Configure linting and formatting tools
- Add source code structure

This CLAUDE.md should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.

## Rules

- DO NOT touch GIT
- DO NOT start unless you ask
